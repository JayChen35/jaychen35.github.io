# Foreword

Like many children of immigrants, I grew up speaking the native language of my parents while growing up in America.
This meant that I'm fluent in spoken Mandarin Chinese, but struggle to read and write it. As I grew older, not only
did I realize how important it was to retain this ability, but also how I wanted to retain the cultural aspects of
language so that I could pass it on to my children.

Luckily, music perfectly fits the bill. As I get more busy in adult life, a higher proportion of my exposure to
Chinese comes from listening to Chinese songs, and learning from them.

I've created this page as a catalogue of my favorite songs, with Traditional Characters, Pinyin, and an English
translation listed together. I hope you find it useful!

> [!NOTE]
> I highly recommend installing the _**ZhongZhong: Improved Chinese Dictionary**_ extension on Chromium-based browsers
> (e.g. Chrome, Brave, Arc). It translates and shows the Pinyin for Chinese characters just by hovering your cursor
> over the character within your browser.
