A list of Vim commands that you'll actually use.

# Movement

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `h j k l` |	Move the cursor up, down, left, right
| `e w` |	Move forwards to end of word, move forwards to the start of a word
| `b` | 	Move backwards to start of word
| `i a` | Insert/append, goes to the left/right side of current character
| `I A` | Insert at the beginning of the line, append at the end of the line
| `o O` |	Insert line below/above
| `%` | Jump to matching parenthesis/quote
| `f[CHAR]` |	Jumps to next occurrence of [CHAR]
| `[NUMBER]G` | Jumps to line [NUMBER]
| `g_` | Jumps cursor to the last non-whitespace character in the line

# Editing

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `d` | Deletes. Can combine with movement, i.e. dw deletes the word to the right of the cursor, db deletes to the left of the cursor
| `x X` |	Deletes single character before/after cursor
| `daw` | Deletes the entire word under the cursor
| `c[i/a][DELIMITER]` | Select everything inside DELIMITER (such as `""`  or `()`, and DELIMITER = `w` means current word), and replace it (enters INSERT mode). Using i means inner, i.e. the word inside the delimiter, while a will include the delimiter
| `v[i/a][DELIMITER]` | Same thing as above but selects (visually) instead of changing the word
